# Todo-list Web App ✏️✅

This is a todo web app built with webpack. It enables you to create, update, and delete tasks and groups of tasks. The main goal of building this app was to learn webpack and its capabilities for bundling and optimizing JavaScript applications, while also enhancing my JavaScript skills.
